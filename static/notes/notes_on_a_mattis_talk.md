Subject: Mattis talk to a group of veterans, Veteran's Day 2024

Note: some of these are near direct quotes, but somewhat fragmentary. The ideas are
there, but attribution is to Mattis. This hops around because the talk was also
largley unstructured and based on submitted questions, Q&A.

* Quotes Oliver Holmes: "I think that, as life is action and passion, it is
  required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at
  peril of being judged not to have lived."
* America is too large at heart to abide differences between us.
* Deny cynicism a role in our world: cynicism is an act of absolving ourselves
  of responsibility for conditions, and just another form of giving up, it has
  no positive impact. Hardship often results in taking refuge in this form of
  victimhood.
* You should be satisfied how you conducted yourself. -Dumas
* Accept that the alignment of teams is different in the *** than in the
  military.
* Putting others first is the only shortcut to happiness. Increase your
  happiness for others and this extends leadership, servant leadership.
* Anecdote: Stanford study states that 68% of workers don't know what is
  expected of them. Always have a strong idea of what you are doing, or assert
   it anyway and move forward. Veterans are used to forming these positive
   lateral bonds and are often used for this purpose to onboard others to
   companies, because they are used to forming these positive positions and
   leadership up front.
* Training and integration are critical to creating in-culture, leadership, and
  so on.
* First 72h of a new employee's experience set all of a worker's expectations.
  This is the importance of onboarding. I recall my onboarding with *** wasn't
  good and did set the tone since then: a very crass and impatient tech worker
  badgered me to catch up per a technical issue that had to be resolved on their
  end.
* Active listening and evaluation: listen to what isn't being said. Ask no fewer
  than 8 questions before saying you don't like what someone is doing.
* Evaluation criteria of performance, others: recall that lacking complete
  information, you need to ask 8 questions before determining whether what
  someone is doing is good/correct. Listening defuses polarizing and sticky
  situations, removes background radiation of assumptions.
* Crises: "we are going to be in crisis mode for a while. Demographic change,
  geopolitical shifts, etc. A crisis is always a race between time and
  knowledge. A crisis is unpredictable, which is what makes it a crisis. Crisis
  leadership is unique, A traveller pulls off the road and sees a few scrawny
  people, Plague and Fear. They describe they are going up to London to kill a
  million people. The traveler asks Plague how he is going to do so, and Plague
  responds "Oh no, I'm only going to kill 100 people. Fear is going to get the
  rest." -Mattis.
* Initiative and aggressiveness should be rewarded: others see it, and emulate
  it. An organization gets the behavior it rewards. [unclear if these are quotes
  or my notes, since this is some verbatim from Call Sign Chaos]. Player/coach
  works best. I had a gunner teach me how to disassemble in the dark, then I
  would coach. There's no gap between you and them, performing well or poorly. A
  player/coach can command in about 10 minutes a day, all know what they are
  doing, all know their tasks. These methods stayed consistent whether leading
  young or old, experienced or inexperienced.
* On leadership roles: do you like enabling others? Many people don't think of
  enabling others because they are shy or introverted. Do you enjoy problems?
  Mattis often thought about what was necessary for peace for one more year, one
  more month, one more hour.
* Always distinguish between a mistake and a lack of discipline in subordinates.
  * I like this, especially when you invert it: always distinguish between a
    mistake and lack of discipline in leadership. "Stay in the midfield". Don't
    tar others, praise publicly, teach privately.
* On leadersip in the military: "If you run your ship on the rocks, they will
  drop kick you through the goalposts of life. You are responsible for your
  crew, what they do and don't do. Leadership isn't burger king, you don't make
  it your way."
* On polarization: he was in Anbar province, losing men, outnumbered. Had 29
  sailors and marines, and each day in four months... 17 were killed or wounded.
  Driving to a screen line on the Syrian border, a group was manning a post on
  the border to stop foreign fighters from infiltrating to kill Americans and
  Iraqis in Baghdad. About midnight they pulled over to a post, the CO informed
  him about activity. They caught a guy, Sunni, with two years engineering
  education in London who was setting IEDs. They brought him out. Mattis asked
  why he was there and the man ranted about Jews, Americans, etc. Mattis
  dismissed him. The man asked to stay. The man described just not liking
  foreign troops in his country. The man asked if he could ask one last
  question, and asked if he was a model prisoner if his family could emigrate to
  America. The power of America's insiration overcame his hatred, and would do
  anything to be in the U.S. Each day every radio station teaches you to hate or
  be suspicious of others. We will get this country back to showing affection
  toward one another. It will take our actions to set this example.
