    TODO:
    - Polishing: probably the best example out there of an interactive resume: http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile
    - Quotes: Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.

    Possible additions:

    Personal:
    - Build a shelf of leadership examples: by building your shelf of leadership (books specifically, though not
    necessarily) you are inadvertently building a toolbox for future events, and a source of stability
    through volatile times.
    - When Leaders Fail: How to respond to 'bad' leaders? : We live in an age of misleadership. Period.
    But this diminishes our ability to learn from leaders who have made mistakes. Time spent diminishing
    is time wasted not building. There is a lot of Aurelius in this. Also recall the avalanche story with
    James at North Bend (McClelland butte?).
    - Myths of Leadership: do you have to be formally in charge to exercise leadership? No. Do you have
    to have extensive power and experience to develop your leadership skills? No. Can you benefit
    enormously by building up the leadership muscles of your mind? Absolutely. The focus would be on 
    young men in a bad economy, imparting experience, how to survive/thrive/build amidst decline by
    way of stoic independence, an developing a will to lead. Note my best leaders all had the 'lowest'
    social positions: Jeff at the shop, Juan at the casino, boomer tradesmen, Rick at the casino, etc.
    Leadership and clout are not the same; I succeeded beyond my home because I quietly improved myself
    and learned from others when others were chasing clout (and, frankly, dying of opiates etc).
    - Sentinels: sentinels are random individuals who bear witness to the upbringing and conditions of those in their
    local community. A perfect example is a former bus driver I met who drove the same route for eleven
    years, seeing the same kids develop from middle school through high school. He knew the 'trigger
    kids' by whom others would be diverted and encouraged toward problematic behavior. After leaving,
    the route went through five or more drivers in a single year. The sentinel was gone. Sentinels describe
    the social capital of an area.
    - Communication: written and spoken communication are virtually dead, but you're going to spend
    hours of your career in meetings for whatever reason. Oh well. Communication is a core component
    to developing leadership, for which the best tools are not coherently organized. But I think the
    best of these are: Strunk and Whites Elements of Style and Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence
    People. Beyond that its merely personal experience: lots of practice writing in school/college when you
    are young, then when you are older, lots of practice preserving and converting your experiences into 
    durable knowledge of things. Avoid the slide into "No Ragrets" gopnik. Value language: say what you
    mean and mean what you say. Language is the foremost signifier by which people understand that you 
    are a serious person (not an arrogant person but someone with objectives and respects others' objectives).
    Core themes are: language development, language significance (like formal clothes, good language signals
    sincere seriousness), language defiance (strong language fortifies one against charlatans), listening
    as a form of language (see how deeply you can memorize and understand a conversation with a stranger).

    Inverse list: my list of worst leadership books. Forgettable, clout-chasing,
    - Simon Sinek: the youtube clip-art of the leadership grift, Start With Why
    - Followership: promotes followership as good
    - The Art of War, The Prince, and generally anything DIY machiavellian in nature.
    - Harvard Business Review
    - LinkedIn
    - Leadership Gold and anything by Maxwell: is Maxwell overrated?
    - How to Be an Anti-Racist, We Cant Talk About That At Work, The New Jim Crow. HTBAAR tells
      multiple lies by about page 5, attributing quotes to people that they did not say; and yet the
      Navy has it on its reading list.
    - The Phoenix Project? Is this a book or failure porn?

    To read/review:
    - The Anatomy of Change - Richard Strozzi (Dominic recommendation)
    - Phoenix Project - I think this goes on the crap/pulp pile.

    This inspires a useful question about what makes a good leadership book:
    - it requires effort from the reader
    - the author has genuine experience/value they wish to pass along. are they writing for money/clout
      or would they have written something even if they believed it might not be written? Meditations for example.
    - it acknowledges a real failure in current leadership, but communicates it effectively and manifests though
      about mediating/resolving the difference

            These are free-form personal journals and reviews of leadership material.
            No book must be primarily about leadership to hold merit.

            <div class="simple-entry">To quote General Mattis, "If you don't read, you can't lead."
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Call Sign Chaos</i>, General Jim Mattis</p>
                        <p>
                            I admire Mattis' calling for leaders
                            to '<i>protect their mavericks and risk takers, and reward initiative and
                                aggressiveness</i>'.
                            For Marines, aggressiveness clearly refers to those exercising the strongest initiative,
                            such as
                            youthful itinerants like young Mattis himself. Progress is impossible when
                            organizations are too timid to break
                            s***,
                            including organizational lassitude. Innovation requires aggressiveness. But leaders
                            must temper zeal with self-discipline and reading. To not read is to forego the acquired
                            knowledge for which previous
                            leaders believed it was worthwhile to record their experiences.
                            Thus if I could summarize Mattis' leadership principles, albeit inaccurately:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="margin: 10px 0px;">
                            <li>
                                Vertical alignment by intended outcomes, rather than detailed directives: "<b>in
                                    order to</b> take the bridge" "<b>in order to</b> deny egress" "<b>in order to</b>
                                _________"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Lateral aggressiveness and competency
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Learn from your predecessors, read voraciously
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Mattis spoke to a packed auditorium at my old university and his appeal is easy to
                            understand. The Marines' leadership mindset is well-compartmentalized: you have a role,
                            you understand your role, you fulfill your role. Combined with the values of fraternity,
                            self-discipline, and learning/adapting/exercising, it is easy to understand why that mindset
                            is
                            infectious, and likewise dovetails with Aurelius' stoicism. Solely for emphasizing reading
                            and listening, Mattis distinguishes himself as a leader capable of much greater public
                            significance. I wish to hear more of him in the future. When speaking on leadership and
                            democracy, he does so without engaging in the commonplace self-dealing prevalent within
                            universities, media, and corporations, a core reason for their decreasing
                            national relevance.

                        <p><i>Endurance</i>, Alfred Lansing</p>
                        <p>The greatest account of determination against oarlocks, the
                            Shackleton expedition's survival is arguably misattributed to Shackleton himself rather than
                            his team. The sequence of hardships they experienced exemplify Mattis' 'direct leadership'
                            as a chain of short-term contexts and decisions made under environmental uncertainty to
                            achieve a single long-term objective: saving as many crew as possible. Shackleton did so by
                            keeping problematic crew members nearer himself, but otherwise unleashing the capabilities
                            of a skilled team to operate independently and effectively. This is a credit to the team's
                            hand-picked composition, experts in their trades except for one stowaway. In their moment,
                            such men could not know what outcome might follow, only that positive outcomes would proceed
                            solely from their own actions. There is no luck but hard luck, but that is the best we have.

                            Survival narratives struggle against readers' natural psychological resistance to
                            fully contemplate a context in which absolute mortal consequences and uncertainty are
                            pitted against the personal commitment (and a difficult one) to act toward survival:
                            the acceptance of one's situation and the conscious choice to behave rationally and
                            agreeably toward difficult goals. The fascinating part about the team was their
                            cheery acceptance of circumstance, and the collective understanding of each man's value
                            and responsibilities, including the responsibility not to share spoiling attitudes in
                            the face of uncertainty. No bad situation is chosen, but good outcomes can only extend
                            from choice.

                            Because believe it or not, it is a lesser known fact of history (by 2022 standards anyhow)
                            that T.E. Lawrence would today be a highly self-serious Tom Clancy ghostwriter,
                            and Wilfred Owen an operator of several 'osint' twitter accounts (otherwise
                            known as 'googling') for re-posting slick drone warfare videos from a tony hot cocoa

                            military history
                            narratives make good-faith attempts to memorialize major national events, they often
                            disappoint because of the loss of gritty firsthand knowledge, very much including the
                            vulgarity of real events and their participants. Murphy's law is a democracy of demons,
                            in combat as much as engineering, and doesn't reduce to solo-hero narratives.
                            Perhaps autocratic societies still have bars because ultimately people can still
                            distinguish hard truth from Falstaffian puffery.

                        <p>
                            So nevermind that Sharp's book hails from the CAPITAL LETTERS
                            section. Nor that much of the story may be deliberate fabrication. It provided
                            something I'd never encountered: a professional engineering
                            memoir. Except that this memoir is about&#8212;well&#8212;stealing a sunken Russian
                            submarine:
                            engineering multiple massive and unproven custom apparatuses, coordinating front
                            companies and
                            stories, Howard Hughes Corp, ops-sec lapses, Soviet surveillance, and a large-scale project
                            with mixed outcomes (familiar to any large software contract). Most of us should
                            stick to mastering the 25&#162; claw game at Safeway, but I hope Sharp kept the 240z and the
                            K-129 fialka in the glovebox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given my own fascination with Project Azorian, the
                            interesting part of Sharp's account is that the spy intrigue subsided and yielded
                            to a professional project memoir that is relatable to anyone involved in a
                            large-scale engineering project.
                            All such endeavors yield mixed outcomes and survivor-guilt
                            levels of personal second-guessing. Every engineer should cringe when reading about the
                            moment the heave-compensator slammed to its stops. The discipline
                            required to carry through such an extensive multi-year project is admirable in itself,
                            and one envies its field work. The scale of Azorian was an amazing undertaking,
                            unique for its managerial and engineering requirements. It ought to be more well-known
                            to the public as a major Cold War military-engineering accomplishment. The beauty of
                            Sharp's memoir is that in an era when professional responsibility and leadership are openly

                            faced by engineers, which is perhaps what makes the work so interesting and healthy.
                            I look forward to seeing it on the big screen, because even a mediocre
                            production would be entertaining given the merits of Azorian itself.

                            <i>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders</i>, L. David
                            Marquet
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Turning followers into leaders' oozes TED Talk cliches. But on reflection,
                            <i>followership</i> forms the basis of every social media platform, most professional
                            credentials, and 99% of LinkedIn (which I ditched for exactly this reason). There is even a
                            book of the same title promoting 'followership' with all the false optimism of early-oughts
                            marketing 3.0 optimism.
                            Marquet instead instructs us to use language to substitute subordination ("Sir, may
                            I ____") with intent: "Sir, I intend to ____". Conscientiously structuring language is the
                            low-hanging fruit of leadership praxis, a subtle team contract that a leader is
                            someone who creates other leaders. Marquet is a
                            perfect complement to Mattis. Whereas Mattis' vertical leadership principle
                            emphasizes communicating intent downward, Marquet's principle emphasizes pushing
                            subordinates upward by harnessing their 'intent' and building up their (autonomous)
                            initiative. This appropriately decouples leaders and subordinates, notably without a bunch
                            of obtuse language about 'decentralization'. Marquet does not seek to replace
                            leadership hierarchy but to ensure that it exists to maximize initiative and the creation
                            of new leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the main theme of Marquet's book is to encompass an entire organization in
                            leadership, and to not yield to reductive authority roles. A somewhat common example, I
                            worked at an organization where favoritism and dubious dev point metrics resulted in some
                            workmates disproportionately receiving greenfield tasks, thus building their skillsets while
                            starving others equally qualified. Like all such non-linear point schemes, the scoring
                            system merely encouraged developers to assign themselves easy tasks and discouraged more
                            difficult ones, which by definition can be nearly impossible to estimate (i.e. bug hunts).
                            The result was that many colleagues adopted an attitude of subordination, precisely because,
                            being downstream of the objectives,
                            they were essentially being required to ask permission to do their work, as well as being
                            discouraged from doing the real work of quality and security (essentially, the core problem
                            that dev-sec-ops intends to address). Projects became progressively more buggy because the
                            point system disincentivized addressing quality issues, while favoring
                            the proliferation of new and undocumented code. And without greenfield tasks, downstream
                            workmates did not adequately develop their own creative intuition about how things could be
                            done, but were pinioned by what already had been done, and was very often done poorly.
                            Many developers seemingly did not advance their skillsets or experience, despite doing lots
                            of apparent work. Several moved on to better companies.
                            Likewise, providing insightful feedback regarding machine learning applications (a core
                            product domain), security, or open source dev productivity tooling was regarded with
                            suspicion by leads for being 'out of one's lane' or a threat to their kingdom. Virtually the
                            entire company's software operations were structured in this manner, as silo'ed, feuding
                            kingdoms, a matrix of rivalries that produced little for its partipants and turned the
                            software into internally-focused and awkwardly overlapping mishmash (Conway's law).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This team organization formed a self-fulfilling hierarchy of role-acquiescence.
                            Engineers' capabilities exceeded the constraints created by upstream bottleneckers, but the
                            company culture presented toxic subservience as 'being a team player' and other cringe
                            cliches. Nor would I hesitate to work with any of those team members again, whom I know to
                            be bright and sensitive to criticism; I moved on for unrelated reasons.
                            But without encouraging subordinates to develop their own leadership skills and technical
                            autonomy, and without cultivating an attitude that leadership may arise from any team
                            member, capabilities are supplanted by subordination and a culture of asking permission.
                            I think of that experience solely in terms of lost capabilities and advancement,
                            and the weeks spent fixing others' bugs instead of developing relevant skills and valuable
                            products. My final year consisted almost entirely of re-work of others mistakes, rather than
                            actual work.
                            The experience is commonplace in an industry ruled by technical debt, but provides
                            a stark contrast to the Shackleton approach of assembling team members for autonomy, not
                            obedience to self-preserving hierarchy. It's always strange that highly intelligent
                            people can be so adept at role-acceptance as such (I am as guilty as anyone else).
                            Marquet's book is a refreshing antidote, especially in the tech
                            industry. A welcome read, and a book that should probably be re-read periodically.

                        <p><i>Servant Leadership</i>, Robert K. Greenleaf</p>
                        <p> Servant Leadership reads more like Kant than leadership pulp. Whereas the latter is flatters
                            its readership to pump up book sales, Servant Leadership is valuable precisely because it
                            requires effort to grasp. Rather than tossing a cape on every middle-manager, bored
                            administrator, or appealing to readers' narcissisism, Servant Leadership represents
                            an omega-male's earnest attempt to understand authority-based leadership. What makes Servant
                            Leadership so current is that its message is retrograde to the withered, self-serving
                            realizations of leadership in 2020's America. However if you look for the servant-leaders
                            within any organization, you discover their actual structure and capabilities. I
                            once implemented a network-security project analyzing organizational hierarchy in the
                            Enron dataset and several employees within the company were easily identified as critical
                            servant-leaders, without whom the company could not have operated (otherwise ignoring
                            Enron's fate). They did not bear titles or rank within the company that matched
                            the importance of their roles. Servant-leaders exist within every organization and provide
                            key operational insights. A quote from Greenleaf's site summarizes the core qualities of
                            servant-leadership:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <i>
                                The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make sure that
                                other people's highest priority needs are being served. The best test, and difficult to
                                administer, is: Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become
                                healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?
                                And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or at
                                least not be further deprived?
                            </i>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Servant-leadership is an explication of Marquet's belief that a leader
                            is one who creates other leaders:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                it is evaluated based on the production of new leaders and autonomous action
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it emphasizes horizontal definitions of service
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it refutes the utility of vertical hierarchies which diminish autonomy
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Greenleaf often strays into the arcadian weeds when praising a kind of horizontal
                            servant-leadership organization akin to every "empowerment" fad crossing
                            one's career feeds. The arc of institutions pursuing
                            these agenda have historically concluded with the strongest examples of staunch, vertical
                            authoritarianism (see Orwell's Animal Farm or any 2020's university administration).
                            Though I subscribe to servant-leadership in principle, I reject
                            Greenleaf's aesthetic. Or can it even have one? There was this one guy 2000 years ago who
                            mentioned something
                            about the corrosive societal consequences of doing good deeds for recognition, versus doing
                            so without reciprocation and without a witness. Although I love the concept of
                            servant-leadership (as someone who has occupied the role in many companies I've worked for)
                            I can leave the 1970's boomer-identity gospel and keep the practical bits. Vertical
                            hierarchy is not an intrinsic evil; it can easily be argued that horizontal
                            servant-leadership and vertical authority should simply be balanced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Peer within any company, no matter its health (hence the Enron example), and
                            you will find core staff who sincerely believe in its survival, mission, and purpose.
                            Their titles are often a mismatch with respect to their (usually unobserved)
                            operational importance. But were they taught to do so?
                            Can servant leadership be taught, as every quasi-leadership "empowerment" project suggests?
                            I would be as radical as to claim that, for several generations now, America has lacked
                            any prior reference that would make servant-leadership intelligible to its
                            intended audience. It will be intelligible to those who already inately possess the value,
                            for whom no training is needed, and otherwise just another lever for covert self-service.

                        <p>
                            So can it be realized, or it just the latest organizational fetish on LinkedIn?
                            I once had a friend who became enamoured with outdoor
                            magazines and fancied himself a mountaineer adventurer. When we climbed together, he was
                            completely incompetent and would easily become lost, mislead others, and fall into streams,
                            and was also unwilling to learn basic skills. Evidently to be enamoured with skills does not
                            impart them. In mountaineering it became routine to encounter such dangerous dilletantes,
                            as a few of them put themselves or others in critical danger and in need of rescue.
                            Woke'ish leadership crusades represent a similar confusion between skill and the work that
                            begets it, diminishing the work out of envy for skill:
                            genuine leadership skills are not a thing in-themselves to be bought like some transferrable
                            currency or personal status product (Teslas, iphones, etc).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Skill is an expression of work, and of an individual's commitment to surmount the burdens
                            of a task, subject, etc. The assumption that it might be easily transferrable reflects
                            a fundamental misunderstanding of the long-term requirements of leadership, and a seeming
                            violation of servant-leadership's core ethos itself, which is that leadership entails
                            <i>doing work</i>. In that regard, and not to be too stereotypical, who are servant
                            leaders but plumbers and janitors? By contrast, what then of the credential spigot
                            of a higher education system awash in elitism, for which every
                            accomodation and recognition <i>must</i> be made, no matter how frivolous or unyielding of
                            company value? The entire premise of paying for a college degree (particularly advanced
                            degrees in law, management, and STEM) is sold in overtly classist terms: 'a degree gains
                            you entry to the over-class'. Thereby, the wokies decrying matters of class are the ones
                            affirming it. The very concept of this saintly insider class--programmers, lawyers,
                            directors, etc.--contradicts the notion of work: how does a diploma give one permission to
                            work? Or, let's be honest here, is it really an implied exemption from work? What
                            is the survival timeline of servant leadership in this era of near programmatic
                            mimetic-envy? Of eased character, and diminished leadership? These are controversial but
                            necessary questions for Greenleaf.
