    TODO:
    - Polishing: probably the best example out there of an interactive resume:
      http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile
    - Quotes: Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when
      you don't have strength.

    Possible additions:

    Personal:
    - Build a shelf of leadership examples: by building your shelf of leadership
      (books specifically, though not necessarily) you are inadvertently
      building a toolbox for future events, and a source of stability through
      volatile times.
    - When Leaders Fail: How to respond to 'bad' leaders? : We live in an age of
      misleadership. Period. But this diminishes our ability to learn from
      leaders who have made mistakes. Time spent diminishing is time wasted not
      building. There is a lot of Aurelius in this. Also recall the avalanche
      story with James at North Bend (McClelland butte?).
    - Myths of Leadership: do you have to be formally in charge to exercise
      leadership? No. Do you have to have extensive power and experience to
      develop your leadership skills? No. Can you benefit enormously by building
      up the leadership muscles of your mind? Absolutely. The focus would be on
      young men in a bad economy, imparting experience, how to
      survive/thrive/build amidst decline by way of stoic independence, an
      developing a will to lead. Note my best leaders all had the 'lowest'
      social positions: Jeff at the shop, Juan at the casino, boomer tradesmen,
      Rick at the casino, etc. Leadership and clout are not the same; I
      succeeded beyond my home because I quietly improved myself and learned
      from others when others were chasing clout (and, frankly, dying of opiates
      etc).
    - Sentinels: sentinels are random individuals who bear witness to the
      upbringing and conditions of those in their local community. A perfect
      example is a former bus driver I met who drove the same route for eleven
      years, seeing the same kids develop from middle school through high
      school. He knew the 'trigger kids' by whom others would be diverted and
      encouraged toward problematic behavior. After leaving, the route went
      through five or more drivers in a single year. The sentinel was gone.
      Sentinels describe the social capital of an area.
    - Communication: written and spoken communication are virtually dead, but
      you're going to spend hours of your career in meetings for whatever
      reason. Oh well. Communication is a core component to developing
      leadership, for which the best tools are not coherently organized. But I
      think the best of these are: Strunk and Whites Elements of Style and
      Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. Beyond that its merely
      personal experience: lots of practice writing in school/college when you
      are young, then when you are older, lots of practice preserving and
      converting your experiences into durable knowledge of things. Avoid the
      slide into "No Ragrets" gopnik. Value language: say what you mean and mean
      what you say. Language is the foremost signifier by which people
      understand that you are a serious person (not an arrogant person but
      someone with objectives and respects others' objectives). Core themes are:
      language development, language significance (like formal clothes, good
      language signals sincere seriousness), language defiance (strong language
      fortifies one against charlatans), listening as a form of language (see
      how deeply you can memorize and understand a conversation with a
      stranger).

    Inverse list: my list of worst leadership books. Forgettable, clout-chasing,
    - Simon Sinek: the youtube clip-art of the leadership grift, Start With Why
    - Followership: promotes followership as good
    - The Art of War, The Prince, and generally anything DIY machiavellian in
      nature.
    - Harvard Business Review
    - LinkedIn
    - Leadership Gold and anything by Maxwell: is Maxwell overrated?
    - How to Be an Anti-Racist, We Cant Talk About That At Work, The New Jim
      Crow. HTBAAR tells multiple lies by about page 5, attributing quotes to
      people that they did not say; and yet the Navy has it on its reading list.
    - The Phoenix Project? Is this a book or failure porn?

    To read/review:
    - The Anatomy of Change - Richard Strozzi (Dominic recommendation)
    - Phoenix Project - I think this goes on the crap/pulp pile.

    This inspires a useful question about what makes a good leadership book:
    - it requires effort from the reader
    - the author has genuine experience/value they wish to pass along. are they
      writing for money/clout or would they have written something even if they
      believed it might not be written? Meditations for example.
    - it acknowledges a real failure in current leadership, but communicates it
      effectively and manifests though about mediating/resolving the difference

            <h3>Lit</h3>
            <div class="simple-entry">To quote General Mattis, if you don't
                read, you can't lead.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Call Sign Chaos</i>, General Jim Mattis</p>
                        <p>
                            I admire Mattis' call to 'protect their mavericks
                            and risk takers, and reward initiative and
                            aggressiveness'. For Marines, aggressiveness means
                            exercising the strongest initiative, such as
                            youthful itinerants like young Mattis himself.
                            Progress is impossible when people and organizations
                            are too timid to break s***, including
                            organizational comfort. Innovation requires
                            aggressiveness. But leaders must temper zeal with
                            self-discipline and reading. To forego reading is to
                            forego the intelligence for which previous leaders
                            believed it was worthwhile to record their
                            experience. If I could loosely summarize Mattis'
                            leadership principles:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="margin: 10px 0px;">

                                Vertical alignment by intended outcomes, rather
                                than detailed directives: "<b>in order to</b>
                                take the bridge" "<b>in order to</b> deny
                                egress" "<b>in order to</b>
                                _________"

                                Lateral aggressiveness and competency

                            <li>
                                Learn from your predecessors, read voraciously
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Mattis' <a href="./static/media/mattis.jpg">letter
                                to troops</a> prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq
                            provides an example of these principles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People often quote Mattis because they think it
                            imparts swagger, but this misdirects from a
                            historically-informed and empirical leadership
                            style. Put bluntly, Mattis is a cosmopolitan, which
                            means he doesn't care about how he will be evaluated
                            by people not named Mattis. It also means that he
                            places the world (people, problems, obstacles) as
                            prior to his representation of their facts, and
                            therefore, one does not try to change the world to
                            fit one's objectives but rather to understand and
                            respond to direct conditions in turn. The mantra of
                            "improvise, adapt, overcome" directly applies to a
                            leadership process that deploys objectives, derives
                            feedback, adjusts, and continually searches out
                            utility in others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mattis spoke to a packed auditorium at my old
                            university and his appeal is easy to understand. The
                            Marines' leadership mindset is
                            well-compartmentalized: you have a role, you
                            understand your role, you fulfill your role.
                            Combined with fraternity, self-discipline, and
                            learning/adapting/exercising, it is easy to
                            understand why that mindset is infectious, and
                            likewise dovetails with Aurelius' stoicism.
                            Encouragement toward literacy and listening was what
                            spared me from the fatal outcomes of my peers, so
                            you can imagine my earnest loyalty listening to
                            someone state it as a formal leadership principle.
                            Mattis distinguishes himself as a leader capable of
                            greater public significance. I wish to hear more of
                            him in the future. When speaking on leadership and
                            democracy, he does so without the self-dealing
                            prevalent within universities, media, and
                            corporations, a core reason for their decreasing
                            national relevance.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Endurance</i>, Alfred Lansing</p>
                        <p>The greatest account of determination against the
                            oarlocks, the Shackleton expedition's survival is
                            arguably misattributed to Shackleton rather than his
                            team. Their sequence of hardships exemplify Mattis'
                            'direct leadership': a chain of short-term contexts and
                            decisions made under environmental uncertainty to
                            achieve the grim objective of saving as many crew as
                            possible. Shackleton did so by keeping problematic crew
                            members near himself, but otherwise unleashing the
                            capabilities of a skilled team to operate independently
                            and effectively. This is a credit to the team's
                            hand-picked composition, trade experts except for one
                            stowaway. In their moment, none could know the outcome
                            that might follow, only that positive outcomes would
                            proceed solely from their own actions. There is no luck
                            but hard luck, but that is the best we have.

                            Survival narratives break against readers'
                            psychological resistance to contemplate situations
                            for which absolute consequences and mortal
                            uncertainty are pitted against the personal
                            commitment (and a difficult one) to act toward
                            survival: the acceptance of one's situation and the
                            conscious choice to behave rationally and agreeably
                            toward difficult goals. The fascinating character of
                            the team was their cheery acceptance of
                            circumstance, and the collective understanding of
                            each man's value and responsibilities, including the
                            responsibility not to share spoiling attitudes in
                            the face of uncertainty. No bad situation is chosen,
                            but good outcomes only extend from choice.

                            absolute control over how you respond to it.
                            <i>Meditations</i> is a masterpiece that speaks for
                            itself.

                            admission to the military history section at your local
                            book store. It is hard to conceive that T.E. Lawrence
                            would today be a highly self-serious Tom Clancy
                            ghostwriter, or Wilfred Owen an operator of several
                            'osint' twitter accounts for reposting graphic drone
                            warfare videos like 90s skater reel, but seemingly not
                            by 2022 standards. Further, even though professional
                            military-history narratives attempt to memorialize
                            events in good-faith, they disappoint because of the
                            loss of gritty firsthand knowledge to second-hand
                            authorship, very much including the vulgarity of real
                            events and participants. I was given a copy of Horse
                            Soldiers by one of the event's real participants, only
                            to puzzle over the author's descriptions of a detainee's
                            eyes resembling "cold tea". Tea color varies by temp?
                            Er, whut?

                        <p>
                            Murphy's law is a democracy of demons, in combat as
                            much as engineering, and doesn't reduce to solo-hero
                            narrative formats and needless symbolism and "cold
                            tea". Given that the military is overwhelmingly
                            working class, is it much to ask that its authorship
                            reflect that culture?

                            So nevermind that Sharp's book hails from the
                            CAPITAL LETTERS section, nor that much of the story
                            may be deliberate fabrication (!). A professional
                            engineering memoir is a rare work. The beauty, of
                            course, is stealing a sunken Russian submarine by
                            engineering multiple massive and unproven custom
                            apparatuses, coordinating front companies and
                            stories, Howard Hughes Corp, opsec lapses, Soviet
                            surveillance, and a large-scale project with mixed
                            outcomes (familiar to any large software contract).
                            Most of us should stick to mastering the 25&#162;
                            claw game at Safeway, but I hope Sharp kept the 240z
                            and the fialka in the glovebox.

                            Despite my personal fascination with Azorian, the
                            spy intrigue subsided and yielded to a professional
                            project memoir akin to any large-scale engineering
                            project. Mixed outcomes, survivor-guilt levels of
                            personal second-guessing. Resources ebb and flow,
                            machines break, people break, and technical
                            assumptions haunt one's sleep. Any engineer would
                            blanche the moment the heave-compensator slammed to
                            the stops. The discipline required to carry through
                            such an extensive multi-year project is admirable in
                            itself, and one envies its field work.

                        <p>
                            Azorian was an amazing undertaking, unique for the
                            scale of its managerial and engineering
                            requirements, one that ought to be more well-known
                            as a major Cold War military-engineering
                            accomplishment. The beauty of Sharp's memoir is that
                            in an era when professional responsibility and
                            leadership are diminishing, Azorian exemplified the
                            absolute professional obligations faced by
                            engineers, which is perhaps what makes such a strong
                            example of personal leadership. It is not that I
                            believe we are in an ethical malaise, but that
                            compared with previous generations, American culture
                            is remarkably unfamiliar with the assertiveness,
                            discipline, and inherent risk of more practical
                            fields like engineering, despite it overflowing with
                            character- and team-driven accomplishments. The
                            movie 'First Man' even removed the US flag from moon
                            landing scenes over concerns about
                            nationalism--despite the fact that the <i><a
                                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZyRbnpGyzQ">fundamental

                            race was the achievement of nationalistic
                            objectives.

                            But I look forward to seeing Azorian on the big
                            screen, because even a mediocre production would
                            entertain, given the merits of the project itself.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Turning followers into leaders' oozes TED Talk
                            cliches. But on reflection,
                            <i>followership</i> forms the basis of every social
                            media platform, most professional credentials, and
                            99% of LinkedIn (which I ditched for exactly this
                            reason). There is even a book of the same title
                            promoting 'followership' with all the false optimism
                            of marketing 3.0 aspirants from the 2000s.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marquet's book distinguishes itself by its focus on
                            the genesis of leadership, rather than leadership
                            as-such. The latter is Steven Covey's 'personality
                            ethic' of poisonous leadership, which reinforces
                            existing leadership roles without addressing how
                            they were created; the former seeks to understand
                            how leaders are created and the conditions thereof.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider the limited number of leadership examples
                            in the public mind, yet the abundance of leaders
                            among your familiar peers. Are leaders determined by
                            their context? The theatrical timing of a historical
                            moment? The resources propping them up? Surely not.
                            "Your duty is to stand straight, not held straight".
                            Leadership must then not inhere in the surrounding
                            context, like some laughtrack, but in the capacity
                            to be both a leader and one worthy of having them. A
                            leader is anyone capable of creating the conditions
                            under which leadership can thrive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, Marquet encourages the language of
                            subordination ("Sir, may I ____") with intent: "Sir,
                            I intend to ____". Conscientiously structuring
                            language is the low-hanging fruit of leadership
                            praxis, a subtle mutual contract that a leader is
                            someone who creates other leaders. Marquet is a good
                            complement to Mattis' executive focus. Whereas
                            Mattis' vertical leadership principle emphasizes
                            communicating intent downward, Marquet's principle
                            emphasizes pushing subordinates upward by harnessing
                            their 'intent' and building their autonomous
                            initiative. This appropriately decouples leaders and
                            subordinates, notably without obtuse language about
                            'decentralization'. Marquet does not seek to replace
                            leadership hierarchy but to ensure that it exists to
                            maximize initiative and the creation of new leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the main theme of Marquet's book is to
                            encompass an entire organization in leadership, and
                            to not yield to reductive or embedded authority
                            roles. A somewhat familiar example to developers, I
                            worked at an organization where favoritism and
                            dubious dev metrics resulted in some workmates
                            disproportionately receiving greenfield tasks, thus
                            building their skillsets, while starving others
                            equally qualified. Like all such non-linear point
                            schemes, the scoring merely encouraged developers to
                            assign themselves easy tasks and discouraged more
                            difficult ones, which by definition can be nearly
                            impossible to estimate (i.e. bug hunts). Being
                            downstream of objectives, the result was that many
                            colleagues adopted an attitude of subordination
                            precisely because they were essentially being
                            required to ask permission to do work, while also
                            being discouraged from doing critically important
                            work of quality and security. The highest value
                            tasks according to the "metrics" (high point, least
                            effort, low value) provided negative value
                            long-term, whereas the lowest value tasks (low
                            points, high effort, high uncertainty) actually had
                            the greatest value to quality and organization
                            survival. (This organizational defect is what
                            DevSecOps directly addresses through continuous
                            integration of quality and security.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the metrics disincentivized addressing quality
                            issues, projects became progressively more buggy,
                            while also favoring the proliferation of new and
                            undocumented code. Technical debt exploded like a
                            fission experiment run amok. And without greenfield
                            tasks, downstream workmates did not adequately
                            develop their creative intuition about how things
                            could be done, but were pinioned by what already had
                            been done, and done very poorly. Notably, many
                            long-term developers did not advance their skillsets
                            or experience, despite doing lots of apparent work.
                            Several moved on to better companies. Likewise,
                            providing insightful feedback regarding machine
                            learning applications (a core product domain),
                            security, or open source dev productivity tooling
                            was regarded with suspicion by leads for being 'out
                            of one's lane' or a threat to someone's kingdom.
                            Virtually the entire company's software activities
                            were structured in this manner, as siloed, feuding
                            kingdoms, a matrix of rivalries that produced little
                            for its partipants and turned the software into
                            internally-focused and awkwardly overlapping
                            mishmash (good ole Conway's law).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Per Marquet, this team organization formed a
                            self-fulfilling hierarchy of role-acquiescence.
                            Engineers' capabilities far exceeded the constraints
                            created by upstream bottleneckers, but the company
                            culture presented toxic subservience as 'being a
                            team player' and other downright cringe. Nor would I
                            hesitate to work with any of those team members
                            again, whom I know to be bright and sensitive to
                            criticism; I moved on for unrelated reasons. But
                            without encouraging subordinates to develop
                            leadership skills and technical autonomy, and
                            without cultivating an attitude that leadership may
                            arise spontaneously from any team member:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>capabilities are supplanted by subordination and

                                or do it twice: dutiful bug fixes require about

                                features)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I attempted to specify the orthogonal components,
                            defined by naturally opposed forces:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>capability/subordination</li>
                            <li>leadership/management</li>
                            <li>growth/debt</li>
                            <li>ownership/delegation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The description is nice because each component is a
                            continuum, and provides a practical mental
                            diagnostic for organizational health. The left-hand
                            elements represent the long-term leadership health
                            of an organization, whereas the right-hand elements
                            represent immediate value (the golden goose eggs).
                            The left-hand elements are the opportunity costs of
                            the right-hand elements. This model might be
                            representable using a radar plot, a personal
                            favorite because they emphasize continuous
                            adjustment rather than perfection.

                            I reflect on that experience primarily in terms of
                            lost capabilities and advancement, and the weeks
                            spent fixing bugs instead of developing relevant
                            skills and valuable products. My final year
                            consisted almost entirely of re-work of others
                            mistakes across a collection of products, rather
                            than actual work. On average, evaluating a single
                            bug led to the discovery of two or three more. The
                            experience is commonplace in an industry ruled by
                            technical debt, but provides a stark contrast to the
                            Shackleton approach of assembling team members for
                            autonomy, not obedience to self-preserving
                            hierarchy. It's always strange that intelligent
                            people can be so adept at role-acceptance as such (I
                            am as guilty as anyone else). Marquet's book is a
                            refreshing antidote, especially in the tech
                            industry. A welcome read, and a book that should be
                            re-read periodically.

                        <p><i>Servant Leadership</i>, Robert K. Greenleaf</p>
                        <p> Servant Leadership reads more like Kant than
                            leadership pulp. Whereas the latter is flatters its
                            readership to pump up book sales, Servant Leadership is
                            valuable precisely because it requires effort to grasp.
                            Rather than tossing a cape on every middle-manager,
                            bored administrator, or appealing to readers'
                            narcissisism, Servant Leadership represents an earnest
                            inquiry into authority-based leadership. But here
                            'authority' is not the embedded sort, but the authority
                            of real work, competency, and earned value. What makes
                            Servant Leadership so current is that its message is
                            retrograde to the stagnant, self-serving realizations of
                            leadership in 2020's America. However if you look for
                            the servant-leaders within any organization, you
                            discover their actual structure and capabilities. I once
                            implemented a network-security project analyzing
                            organizational hierarchy in the Enron dataset and
                            several employees within the company were easily
                            identified as critical servant-leaders, without whom the
                            company could not have operated (otherwise ignoring
                            Enron's fate). Their titles and rank within the company
                            did not match their operational importance.
                            Servant-leaders exist within every organization and
                            provide key structural insights. A quote from
                            Greenleaf's site summarizes the core qualities of
                            servant-leadership:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <i>
                                The difference manifests itself in the care
                                taken by the servant-first to make sure that
                                other people's highest priority needs are being
                                served. The best test, and difficult to
                                administer, is: Do those served grow as persons?
                                Do they, while being served, become healthier,
                                wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely
                                themselves to become servants? And, what is the
                                effect on the least privileged in society? Will
                                they benefit or at least not be further
                                deprived?

                            Servant-leadership is an explication of Marquet's
                            belief that a leader creates other leaders:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                it is evaluated based on the production of new
                                leaders and autonomous action
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it emphasizes horizontal definitions of service
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it refutes the utility of vertical hierarchies
                                that diminish autonomy
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Greenleaf strays into the arcadian weeds when
                            praising a kind of horizontal servant-leadership
                            organization akin to every "empowerment" fad
                            criss-crossing career feeds. The historical arc of
                            institutions pursuing these agenda concludes with
                            the strongest examples of staunch, vertical
                            authoritarianism (see Orwell's Animal Farm or any
                            2020's university campus). Though I subscribe to
                            servant-leadership in principle, I reject
                            Greenleaf's aesthetic. Or can it even have one?
                            There was this one guy 2000 years ago who mentioned
                            something about the corrosive societal consequences
                            of performing deeds for recognition versus doing so
                            without reciprocation and without a witness.
                            Although I love the concept of servant-leadership
                            (as someone who has occupied the role in many
                            companies) I can leave the 1970's
                            boomer-actualization drek and keep the practical
                            bits. Vertical hierarchy is not an intrinsic evil;
                            it can easily be argued that horizontal
                            servant-leadership and vertical authority should
                            simply be balanced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Peer within any company, no matter its health (hence
                            the Enron example), and you will find core staff who
                            sincerely believe in its survival, mission, and
                            purpose. Their titles are usually a mismatch with
                            respect to their unobserved operational importance.
                            But were they taught to do so? Can servant
                            leadership be taught, as quasi-leadership
                            "empowerment" projects suggest? I would radically
                            claim that, for several generations now, America has
                            lacked any prior reference that would make
                            servant-leadership intelligible to its intended
                            audience. It will be intelligible to those who
                            already innately possess the value, for whom no
                            training is needed, and otherwise just another lever
                            for covert self-service. The problem is not
                            servant-leadership, but of conflating it with
                            objectives that nullify the responsibility value
                            that forms its basis. "Caring" and "empowerment" do
                            not of themselves bear competence; competence
                            <em>is</em> caring, and extraordinary competence is
                            more or less the practical definition of
                            servant-leadership. Therefore, if you want to build
                            leaders, build competence. Unleash their existing
                            competencies, but also define paths for them to
                            achieve greater competence; not performance,
                            <i>competence</i>. A mistake I see in most companies
                            is their belief that they must be optimized by
                            finding those with the correct competencies in the
                            future, whereas building them internally would yield
                            those needs more effectively. The truth is that
                            virtually no one knows what their future needs are,
                            just as we as developers should 'code for today' not
                            for future requirements which are impossible to
                            predict.

                            So how can servant-leadership be realized, or is it
                            the latest organizational fetish on LinkedIn?
                            Children of Cold War warriors and the outdoors, my
                            siblings and I grew up mountaineering and hunting.
                            But I once had a friend who became enamoured with
                            outdoor magazines and fancied himself a mountaineer
                            adventurer. When we climbed together he would easily
                            become lost, mislead others, and fall through snow
                            into streams, yet was also unwilling to learn basic
                            skills. Evidently to be enamoured with skills does
                            not impart them. At one point he led our group up
                            the shoulder of an avalanche chute at an unstable
                            time of year, leading by inertia and unwilling to
                            accept that our situation was as dangerous as it
                            was, simply because we weren't yet crushed under
                            chunks of snow and ice, like being pulverized under
                            piles of engine blocks. In mountaineering it was
                            routine to encounter dangerous late-riser
                            dilletantes, most of whom put themselves and others
                            in critical danger and in need of rescue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trendy leadership crusades represent a similar
                            confusion between skill and the work that begets it,
                            diminishing the required work out of envy for skill:
                            genuine leadership skills are not a thing
                            in-themselves to be bought like transferrable
                            currency or lifestyle status products: Teslas,
                            iphones, etc. Bypassing a process of fundamental
                            qualification yields extremely dangerous
                            personalities who operate on inertia and consensus
                            when high-risk environments challenge their
                            insecurities. Such leaders also generally cultivate
                            similarly-minded team members as a defense
                            mechanism. This is most notably exemplified by the
                            actions of the captain and crew of the
                            <i>El Faro</i> prior to its sinking. I would argue
                            that the majority of leadership in America resembles
                            the inertia-based model; in theory, we hear about
                            servant-leadership, but in all practical experience
                            we are closer to the inertia-model.

                            Skill is an expression of work, of an individual's
                            commitment to surmount the burden of a task, a
                            subject, an obstacle. The assumption that it might
                            be easily transferrable represents a fundamental
                            misunderstanding of the long-term requirements of
                            leadership, and seemingly violates
                            servant-leadership's core ethos, which is that
                            leadership is equivalent to
                            <i>doing work</i>. If striving for extraordinary
                            competence is true leadership, then, without being
                            too stereotypically denim, who are servant leaders
                            but plumbers and janitors? By contrast, what then of
                            the credential spigot of a higher education system
                            awash in elitism, for which every accomodation and
                            recognition <i>must</i> be made, no matter how
                            frivolous or unyielding of applied value? The
                            financial premise to borrow lavishly for a college
                            degree (particularly advanced degrees in law,
                            management, and STEM) is overtly classist: 'a degree
                            gains you entry to the over-class'. Curious then,
                            that those decrying class barriers are the ones
                            fortifying them, and standing in their own supposed
                            way. After acing the LSAT, a core reason I bailed on
                            pursuing law school was that every current and
                            prospective law student seemed to rely on the
                            prestige of a law degree as a means to <i>avoid
                                doing work</i>. Law schools themselves market and
                            advance this attitude. The supposition of an insider
                            class&mdash;pajama programmers, lawyers, directors,
                            etc.&mdash;contradicts the notion of work: how does
                            a diploma confer permission to work and produce
                            value? Under what circumstances does a human being
                            require credentials generate value? How can it
                            confer leadership by precluding it? What is the
                            survival timeline of servant-leadership in an era of
                            institutionalized mimetic-envy? Of eased character
                            and leadership standards? These are controversial
                            but necessary questions for a servant-leadership of
                            praxis rather than ethos.

                        <p>
                            Gates of Fire can be a bit of an over-the-top
                            account of Spartan soldiers written from the
                            perspective of a tightjawed New England spectator of
                            'hardship'. But for anyone of a harder upbringing,
                            those whose teens and twenties were a long train of
                            hardship jobs and thankless trades skills, or those
                            who privately cringe whenever the LinkedIn crowd
                            slings terms like "grit", this book is an enjoyable
                            foray into the past hardship that secretly motivate
                            oneself.
