    TODO:
    - Polishing: probably the best example out there of an interactive resume: http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile
    - Quotes: Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.

    Possible additions:

    Personal:
    - Build a shelf of leadership examples: by building your shelf of leadership (books specifically, though not
    necessarily) you are inadvertently building a toolbox for future events, and a source of stability
    through volatile times.
    - When Leaders Fail: How to respond to 'bad' leaders? : We live in an age of misleadership. Period.
    But this diminishes our ability to learn from leaders who have made mistakes. Time spent diminishing
    is time wasted not building. There is a lot of Aurelius in this. Also recall the avalanche story with
    James at North Bend (McClelland butte?).
    - Myths of Leadership: do you have to be formally in charge to exercise leadership? No. Do you have
    to have extensive power and experience to develop your leadership skills? No. Can you benefit
    enormously by building up the leadership muscles of your mind? Absolutely. The focus would be on 
    young men in a bad economy, imparting experience, how to survive/thrive/build amidst decline by
    way of stoic independence, an developing a will to lead. Note my best leaders all had the 'lowest'
    social positions: Jeff at the shop, Juan at the casino, boomer tradesmen, Rick at the casino, etc.
    Leadership and clout are not the same; I succeeded beyond my home because I quietly improved myself
    and learned from others when others were chasing clout (and, frankly, dying of opiates etc).
    - Sentinels: sentinels are random individuals who bear witness to the upbringing and conditions of those in their
    local community. A perfect example is a former bus driver I met who drove the same route for eleven
    years, seeing the same kids develop from middle school through high school. He knew the 'trigger
    kids' by whom others would be diverted and encouraged toward problematic behavior. After leaving,
    the route went through five or more drivers in a single year. The sentinel was gone. Sentinels describe
    the social capital of an area.
    - Communication: written and spoken communication are virtually dead, but you're going to spend
    hours of your career in meetings for whatever reason. Oh well. Communication is a core component
    to developing leadership, for which the best tools are not coherently organized. But I think the
    best of these are: Strunk and Whites Elements of Style and Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence
    People. Beyond that its merely personal experience: lots of practice writing in school/college when you
    are young, then when you are older, lots of practice preserving and converting your experiences into 
    durable knowledge of things. Avoid the slide into "No Ragrets" gopnik. Value language: say what you
    mean and mean what you say. Language is the foremost signifier by which people understand that you 
    are a serious person (not an arrogant person but someone with objectives and respects others' objectives).
    Core themes are: language development, language significance (like formal clothes, good language signals
    sincere seriousness), language defiance (strong language fortifies one against charlatans), listening
    as a form of language (see how deeply you can memorize and understand a conversation with a stranger).

    Inverse list: my list of worst leadership books. Forgettable, clout-chasing,
    - Simon Sinek: the youtube clip-art of the leadership grift, Start With Why
    - Followership: promotes followership as good
    - The Art of War, The Prince, and generally anything DIY machiavellian in nature.
    - Harvard Business Review
    - LinkedIn
    - Leadership Gold and anything by Maxwell: is Maxwell overrated?
    - How to Be an Anti-Racist, We Cant Talk About That At Work, The New Jim Crow. HTBAAR tells
      multiple lies by about page 5, attributing quotes to people that they did not say; and yet the
      Navy has it on its reading list.
    - The Phoenix Project? Is this a book or failure porn?

    To read/review:
    - The Anatomy of Change - Richard Strozzi (Dominic recommendation)
    - Phoenix Project - I think this goes on the crap/pulp pile.

    This inspires a useful question about what makes a good leadership book:
    - it requires effort from the reader
    - the author has genuine experience/value they wish to pass along. are they writing for money/clout
      or would they have written something even if they believed it might not be written? Meditations for example.
    - it acknowledges a real failure in current leadership, but communicates it effectively and manifests though
      about mediating/resolving the difference

                        a timid soul forward ... you don't control your subordinate commanders' every move; you
                        clearly state your intent and unleash their initiative.

            <h3>Lit</h3>
            <div class="simple-entry">To quote General Mattis, "If you don't read, you can't lead."
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Call Sign Chaos</i>, General Jim Mattis</p>
                        <p>
                            I admire Mattis' calling for leaders
                            to '<i>protect their mavericks and risk takers, and reward initiative and
                                aggressiveness</i>'.
                            For Marines, aggressiveness clearly refers to those exercising the strongest initiative,
                            such as
                            youthful itinerants like young Mattis himself. Progress is impossible when
                            organizations are too timid to break
                            s***,
                            including organizational lassitude. Innovation requires aggressiveness. But leaders
                            must temper zeal with self-discipline and reading. To not read is to forego the acquired
                            knowledge for which previous
                            leaders believed it was worthwhile to record their experiences.
                            Thus if I could summarize Mattis' leadership principles, albeit inaccurately:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="margin: 10px 0px;">
                            <li>
                                Vertical alignment by of intended outcomes, rather than detailed directives: "<b>in
                                    order to</b> take the bridge" "<b>in order to</b> deny egress" "<b>in order to</b>
                                _________"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Lateral aggressiveness and competency
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Learn from your predecessors, read voraciously
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Mattis spoke to a packed auditorium at my old university and his appeal is easy to
                            understand. The Marines' leadership mindset is well-compartmentalized: you have a role,
                            you understand your role, you fulfill your role. Combined with the values of fraternity,
                            self-discipline, and learning/adapting/exercising, it is easy to understand why that mindset
                            is
                            infectious, and likewise dovetails with Aurelius' stoicism. Solely for emphasizing reading
                            and listening, Mattis distinguishes himself as a leader capable of much greater public
                            significance. I wish to hear more of him in the future. When speaking on leadership and
                            democracy, he does so without engaging in the commonplace self-dealing prevalent within
                            universities, media, and corporations, a core reason for their decreasing
                            national relevance.

                        <p><i>Endurance</i>, Alfred Lansing</p>
                        <p>The greatest account of determination against the oarlocks, the
                            Shackleton expedition's survival is arguably misattributed to Shackleton himself rather than
                            his team. The sequence of hardships they experienced exemplify Mattis' 'direct leadership'
                            as a chain of short-term contexts and decisions made under environmental uncertainty to
                            achieve a single long-term objective: saving as many crew as possible. Shackleton did so by
                            keeping problematic crew members nearer himself, but otherwise unleashing the capabilities
                            of a skilled team to operate independently and effectively. This is a credit to the team's
                            hand-picked composition, experts in their trades except for one stowaway. In their moment,
                            such men could not know what outcome might follow, but that positive outcomes might solely
                            follow from their own actions. There is no luck but hard luck, but that is
                            the best we have.

                        <p>
                            Survival narratives struggle against readers' natural psychological resistance to
                            fully comprehend a context in which absolute mortal consequences and uncertainty are
                            pitted against the personal choice (and it is a difficult choice) to act toward survival:
                            the acceptance of one's situation and the conscious choice to act rationally and agreeably
                            toward difficult goals. The fascinating part about the team was their apparent cheery
                            acceptance of circumstance, and the collective understanding of each man's responsibilities
                            and value, including the responsibility not to share spoiling attitudes in the face of
                            uncertainty. No bad situation is ever chosen, but good outcomes extend purely from choice.

                            required for admission to the military history section at your local book store.
                            Because believe it or not, it is a lesser known fact of history (by 2022 standards anyhow)
                            that T.E. Lawrence would today be a highly self-serious Tom Clancy ghostwriter,
                            and Wilfred Owen an operator of several 'osint' twitter accounts (otherwise known as
                            googling stuff) for re-posting slick drone warfare videos from a cozy hot cocoa nook in DC.
                            Dulce et Decorum est, Ghost of Kiev. Although slobbering second-hand narratives put forth
                            good-faith attempts to memorialize major national events, they soon disappoint because of
                            the loss of gritty firsthand
                            knowledge, very much including the vulgarity of real events and their participants.
                            Maybe the reason untruthful societies have bars is because ultimately the people
                            still recognize truth from Falstaffian mythos.

                            So nevermind that Sharp's book hails from the CAPITAL LETTERS
                            section. It provided something I had never encountered, an engineering
                            memoir. Except that this memoir is about&#8212;well&#8212;stealing a sunken Russian
                            submarine:
                            engineering multiple massive and unproven custom apparatuses, coordinating front
                            companies and
                            stories, Howard Hughes Corp, ops-sec lapses, Soviet surveillance, and a large-scale project
                            with mixed outcomes (familiar to any large software contract). Most of us should
                            stick to mastering the 25&#162; claw game at Safeway, but I hope Sharp kept the 240z and the
                            K-129 fialka in the glovebox.

                            Given my initial fascination with Project Azorian, the most
                            interesting part of Sharp's account is that the spy intrigue subsided, yielding
                            to a professional project memoir that is highly relatable to anyone involved in a
                            large-scale project. All such endeavors yield mixed outcomes and survivor-guilt levels
                            of long-term personal second-guessing. The discipline
                            required to carry through such an extensive multi-year project is admirable in itself,
                            and I envy its field work. The scale of Azorian was an amazing undertaking,
                            unique for its managerial and engineering requirements. Azorian ought to be more well-known
                            to the public as a major military-engineering accomplishment of the Cold War.

                            <i>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders</i>, L. David
                            Marquet
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Turning followers into leaders' oozes with TED Talk cliches. But on reflection,
                            followership forms the basis of every social media platform, most professional credentials,
                            and 99% of LinkedIn (which I ditched for exactly this reason). There is even a book
                            promoting it.
                            Marquet instructs us to instead use language to substitute subordination ("Sir, may
                            I ____") with intent: "Sir, I intend to ____". Conscientiously structuring language is the
                            low-hanging fruit of leadership praxis, forming a subtle team contract that a leader is
                            someone who creates other leaders and respects subordinates' initiative. Marquet is a
                            perfect complement to Mattis. Whereas Mattis' vertical leadership principle
                            emphasizes communicating intent downward, Marquet's principle emphasizes pushing
                            subordinates upward by harnessing their 'intent' and building up their (autonomous)
                            initiative. This appropriately decouples leaders and subordinates, notably without a bunch
                            of self-contradictory language about 'decentralization'. Marquet does not seek to replace
                            leadership hierarchy but to ensure that it exists to maximize initiative and the creation
                            of new leaders.

                            Perhaps the main themes of Marquet's book are to encompass an entire organization in
                            leadership, and to not yield to reductive authority roles. A somewhat common example, I
                            worked at an organization where favoritism and dubious dev point metrics resulted in some
                            workmates receiving more (if not all) greenfield tasks, thus building their skillsets, while
                            starving others equally qualified. Like most 'point' schemes, the scoring system
                            merely encouraged developers to assign themselves easy tasks and discouraged more
                            difficult ones, which by definition can be nearly impossible to estimate (i.e. bug hunts).
                            The result was that many colleagues adopted an attitude of subordination, precisely because
                            they were being
                            required to ask permission to do their work. Code projects became progressively
                            more buggy because the point system disincentivized addressing quality issues, but favored
                            lots of new and undocumented code. Without greenfield tasks, downstream workmates did not
                            adequately develop their own creative intuition about how things could be done, but were
                            pinioned by what already had been done, and was very often done poorly.
                            Likewise, providing insightful feedback regarding machine learning applications (a core
                            product domain), security, or open source dev productivity tooling was regarded with
                            suspicion by leads for being 'out of one's lane' or a threat to their kingdom. Virtually the
                            entire company's software operations were structured as silo'ed, feuding kingdoms.

                            This team organization formed a self-fulfilling hierarchy of role acceptance, whereby
                            engineers' capabilities exceeded the constraints created by bottleneckers, but the
                            company culture portrayed toxic subservience as 'being a team player', etc.
                            Nor would I hesitate to work with any of those team members again, whom I know to be
                            bright and sensitive to criticism; I moved on for unrelated reasons.
                            But without encouraging subordinates to develop their own leadership skills and technical
                            autonomy, and without cultivating an attitude that leadership should arise from any team
                            member, capabilities are supplanted by subordination and a culture of asking permission.
                            I often think of that experience in terms of the lost capabilities and advancement,
                            and the weeks spent fixing others' bugs instead of developing relevant skills and valuable
                            products. The experience is commonplace in an industry ruled by technical debt, but provides
                            a stark contrast to the Shackleton approach of assembling team members for autonomy, not
                            obedience to self-preserving hierarchy. I always thought it strange that highly intelligent
                            people can be so adept at role-acceptance as such (I am as guilty as anyone, if not the
                            intelligent part :)). Marquet's book is a refreshing antidote, especially in the tech
                            industry. A welcome read, and a book that should probably be re-read periodically.

                        <p>Damn fine book. Zamperini's persistence is a terrific source
                            of motivation and a reminder of the opportunity we enjoy because of his
                            generation. It is also a contrast to how much the culture of Japan has transformed
                            since the 19th and early-20th centuries.

                        <p><i>Servant Leadership</i>, Robert K. Greenleaf</p>
                        <p> Servant Leadership reads more like Kant
                            than leadership pulp, the latter commonly intended to flatter rather than challenge
                            the reader. But it is a valuable book precisely because it requires labor to grasp.
                            Rather than tossing a cape on every middle-manager, bored
                            administrator, or appealing to readers' narcissistic traits, Servant Leadership represents
                            an earnest attempt
                            to understand authority-based leadership. What makes Servant Leadership so current is that
                            its message is retrograde to the withered, self-serving definitions of leadership
                            in 2020's America. But if you look for the servant-leaders within any organization, you tend
                            to discover its actual structure and capabilities. Oddly I once implemented a
                            a network-security project analyzing organizational hierarchy in the Enron dataset
                            and several employees within that company were easily identified as critical
                            servant-leaders, without whom the company couldn't have operated (otherwise ignoring
                            Enron's fate). They did not bear titles or rank within the company that matched
                            the importance of their roles.

                        <p>
                            Gates of Fire can be a bit of an over-the-top account of Spartan soldiers
                            written from the perspective of a tightjawed spectator of 'hardship'.
                            But for anyone of a harder upbringing, those whose teens and twenties were a long
                            train of hardship jobs and thankless trades skills, or those who privately cringe
                            whenever the LinkedIn crowd slings terms like "grit", this book is an enjoyable
                            foray into the past hardship that can secretly motivate one.
