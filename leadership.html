            No book must be primarily about leadership, and in fact, the best of the best often advertise nothing of the

            <div class="simple-entry">To quote General Mattis, "If you don't read, you can't lead." Just be grateful
                this list is short.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Call Sign Chaos</i>, General Jim Mattis</p>
                        <p>
                            I admire Mattis' suggestion that leaders
                            should 'protect their mavericks and risk takers, and reward initiative and aggressiveness'.
                            For
                            Marines, 'aggressiveness' clearly refers to those expressing the strongest initiative,
                            likely
                            young itinerants like Mattis himself. Progress is impossible when you're too timid to break
                            s***,
                            including organizational lassitude. Innovation <i>requires</i> aggressiveness. But leaders
                            must
                            also temper zeal with self-discipline and reading: to not read is to forego the reasons
                            previous
                            leaders believed it was worthwhile to record their experiences. If I could summarize Mattis'
                            leadership principles, albeit perhaps incorrectly:

                        <p><i>Endurance</i>, Alfred Lansing</p>
                        <p>The ultimate account of iron determination against the
                            oarlocks,
                            the
                            Shackleton expedition's survival is arguably misattributed to Shackleton himself and not his
                            team.
                            Endurance exemplifies Mattis' 'direct leadership' as a chain of short-term contexts
                            and decisions made under inscrutable environmental uncertainty, to achieve the single
                            long-term
                            objective of saving as many of his crew as possible. Shackleton did so by keeping
                            problematic
                            crew members near himself, but otherwise unleashing the capabilities of a skilled team to
                            operate independently and effectively.

                        <p>Lol, just joking. I have no idea why this book is on so many reading lists,
                            especially men's oriented reading lists except to communicate some willingness
                            to lie, exploit, and deceive others. Like what? How is that leadership?
                            The Art of War is garbage, or some batman comicbook version of leadership, and is most
                            often meant to communicate willingness to mislead. Yeah... no.

                        <p>Nevermind that this book hails from the CAPITAL LETTERS!
                            military-history section, it provides something unheard of: an engineering memoir. Except
                            that
                            it is
                            a memoir about--well--stealing a Russian submarine, engineering gargantuan pieces of
                            equipment to do so, coordinating front companies and cover stories, Howard Hughes Corp,
                            ops-sec lapses, Soviet surveillance, and a large-scale project with mixed outcomes (in other
                            words,
                            every large software contract). Most of us will stick to mastering the 25 cent claw game at
                            Walmart, but I
                            hope he kept the 240z and the K-129 fialka in the glovebox. Sharp's account is relatable to
                            anyone involved in a large-scale project, which inevitably results in mixed outcomes.

                            Marquet
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Turning followers into leaders' drips TED-Talk cliches, but on reflection, followership
                            forms
                            the
                            basis of every social media platform, most professional credentials, and 99% of LinkedIn
                            (which
                            I ditched long ago, for exactly this reason).
                            Marquet's
                            contribution is using language to substitute subordination ("Sir, may I ____") with intent:
                            "Sir, I intend to ____". Structuring language is the low-hanging fruit of leadership praxis,
                            a subtle team contract that a leader is someone who creates other leaders.

                        <p><i>Unbroken</i>, Laura Hillenbrand</p>
                        <p>Damn fine book. Zamperini's persistence is a terrific source
                            of motivation and a reminder of how much opportunity we enjoy because of the WWII

                        <p><i>Servant Leadership</i>, Robert K. Greenleaf</p>
                        <p> Servant Leadership reads more like Kant
                            than leadership pulp, the latter commonly intended to flatter rather than challenge
                            the reader. It is a valuable book precisely <i>because</i> it requires labor to grasp its
                            message.
                            Rather than tossing a cape on every awful middle-manager, bored
                            administrator, or toxic narcissist reader, Servant Leadership represents an earnest attempt
                            to understand authority-based leadership. What makes Servant Leadership so current is that
                            its message is retrograde to the withered, self-serving definitions of leadership
                            in 2020's America. If you look for the servant-leaders within any organization, you will
                            find
                            its actual structure and capabilities.

                        <p>
                            Gates of Fire can be a bit of an over-the-top account of Spartan soldiers
                            written from the perspective of a tightjawed perspectator of 'hardship'.
                            But for anyone of a harder upbringing, those whose teens and twenties were a long
                            train of hardship jobs and thankless trades skills, or those who privately cringe
                            whenever their superiors sling terms like "synergy", this book is an enjoyable
                            foray into the past hardship that can secretly motivate one.
