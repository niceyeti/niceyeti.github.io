    - Polishing: probably the best example out there of an interactive resume: http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile
    - Quotes: Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.

    Possible additions:

    Inverse list: my list of worst leadership books. Forgettable, clout-chasing,
    - Simon Sinek: the youtube clip-art of the leadership grift, Start With Why
    - Followership: promotes followership as good
    - The Art of War, The Prince, and generally anything DIY machiavellian in nature.
    - Harvard Business Review
    - LinkedIn
    - Leadership Gold and anything by Maxwell: is Maxwell overrated?
    - How to Be an Anti-Racist, We Cant Talk About That At Work, The New Jim Crow
    - 

    This inspires a useful question about what makes a good leadership book:
    - it requires effort from the reader
    - the author has genuine experience/value they wish to pass along. are they writing for money/clout
      or would they have written something even if they believed it might not be written? Meditations for example.
    - it acknowledges a real failure in current leadership, but communicates it effectively and manifests though
      about mediating/resolving the difference

            No book must be primarily about leadership to hold value, and the best often advertise nothing of the sort.

            <h3>Lit</h3>
            <div class="simple-entry">To quote General Mattis, "If you don't read, you can't lead." Pity
                this list is not longer!
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Call Sign Chaos</i>, General Jim Mattis</p>
                        <p>
                            I admire Mattis' calling for leaders
                            to '<i>protect their mavericks and risk takers, and reward initiative and
                                aggressiveness</i>'.
                            For the
                            Marines, 'aggressiveness' clearly refers to those exercising the strongest initiative,
                            such as
                            youthful itinerants like young Mattis himself. Progress is impossible when
                            organizations are too timid to break
                            s***,
                            including organizational lassitude. Innovation requires aggressiveness. But leaders
                            must
                            also temper zeal with self-discipline and reading: to not read is to forego the reasons
                            previous
                            leaders believed it worthwhile to record their experience. If I could summarize Mattis'
                            leadership principles, albeit inaccurately:

                                Vertical understanding of objectives' intent, not details and directives: "<b>in order
                                    to</b> take the bridge"
                                "<b>in order to</b> deny egress" "<b>in order to</b> _________"

                        <p>
                            Mattis spoke to a packed auditorium at my old university and his appeal is easy to
                            understand. The Marines' leadership mindset is well-compartmentalized: you have a role,
                            you understand your role, you fulfill your role. Combined with the values of fraternity,
                            self-discipline, and learning/exercising, it is easy to understand why that mindset is
                            infectious, and likewise dovetails with Aurelius' stoicism. By emphasizing reading
                            and listening, Mattis distinguishes him as a leader capable of greater public
                            significance than retirement to the arcadia of beltway thinktanks and universities.

                        <p><i>Endurance</i>, Alfred Lansing</p>
                        <p>The best account of determination against the oarlocks, the
                            Shackleton expedition's survival is arguably misattributed to Shackleton himself rather than
                            his team. Their hardships exemplify Mattis' 'direct leadership' as a chain of short-term
                            contexts and decisions made under environmental uncertainty to achieve a single long-term
                            objective, saving his crew. Shackleton did so by keeping
                            problematic crew members nearer himself, but otherwise unleashing the capabilities of a
                            skilled team to operate independently and effectively. This is a credit to the composition
                            of his team (but for one stowaway), all experts in their trades. The fascinating
                            part about the Shackleton team was their apparent cheery acceptance of circumstance,
                            and the collective understanding of each man's responsibilities and value, including their
                            responsibility not to share spoiling attitudes.

                            except to communicate one's willingness to lie, exploit, or deceive others
                            as some sort of laudable social skillset.
                            Like what? Is that leadership? The Art of War is garbage, or some batman
                            comicbook version of leadership, and is most often meant to communicate

                            section, it provided something I'd never encountered, an engineering
                            memoir. Except, this memoir is about--well--stealing a sunken Russian submarine:
                            engineering multiple massive custom apparatuses to do so, coordinating front companies and
                            stories, Howard Hughes Corp, ops-sec lapses, Soviet surveillance, and a large-scale project
                            with mixed outcomes (in other words, any large software contract). Most of us will stick
                            to mastering the 25 cent claw game at Walmart, but I hope he kept the 240z and the K-129
                            fialka in the glovebox. Sharp's account is relatable to anyone involved in a large-scale
                            project, all of which inevitably yield mixed outcomes and survivor-guilt levels of
                            long term personal second-guessing. I admire the discipline
                            required to carry through such an extensive multi-year project, and I envy its field work.
                            Azorian was an amazing large-scale undertaking, admirable for its unique
                            management requirements, and ought to be more well-known to the public.

                            <i>Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders</i>, L. David
                            Marquet
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Turning followers into leaders' drips TED-Talk cliches. But on reflection, followership
                            forms the basis of every social media platform, most professional credentials, and 99% of
                            LinkedIn (which I ditched for exactly this reason). There is even a book promoting it.
                            Marquet's instruction is instead to use language to substitute subordination ("Sir, may I
                            ____") with intent: "Sir, I intend to ____". Structuring language is the low-hanging fruit
                            of leadership praxis, a subtle team contract that a leader is someone who creates other
                            leaders. Besides the point about language, perhaps the main theme of Marquet's book
                            is not to allow reductive authority to diminish leadership. Marquet is likely a complement
                            to Mattis. Whereas Mattis' vertical leadership principle emphasizes communicating intent
                            downward, Marquet's principle emphasizes pushing subordinates upward by harnessing their
                            'intent' and building up their (autonomous) initiative. This appropriately decouples leaders
                            and subordinates, notably without a bunch of nonsensical language about 'decentralization'.

                        <p>Damn fine book. Zamperini's persistence is a terrific source
                            of motivation and a reminder of how much opportunity we enjoy because of his

                        <p><i>Servant Leadership</i>, Robert K. Greenleaf</p>
                        <p> Servant Leadership reads more like Kant
                            than leadership pulp, the latter commonly intended to flatter rather than challenge
                            the reader. But it is a valuable book precisely because it requires labor to grasp.
                            Rather than tossing a cape on every middle-manager, bored
                            administrator, or narcissistic reader, Servant Leadership represents an earnest attempt
                            to understand authority-based leadership. What makes Servant Leadership so current is that
                            its message is retrograde to the withered, self-serving definitions of leadership
                            in 2020's America. If you look for the servant-leaders within any organization, you tend
                            to discover its actual structure and capabilities. Oddly I once implemented a
                            a network-security project analyzing organizational hierarchy in the Enron dataset
                            and several employees within that company were easily identified as critical
                            servant-leaders, without whom the company couldn't have operated (otherwise ignoring
                            Enron's fate).

                        <p>
                            Gates of Fire can be a bit of an over-the-top account of Spartan soldiers
                            written from the perspective of a tightjawed spectator of 'hardship'.
                            But for anyone of a harder upbringing, those whose teens and twenties were a long
                            train of hardship jobs and thankless trades skills, or those who privately cringe
                            whenever their superiors sling terms like "grit", this book is an enjoyable
                            foray into the past hardship that can secretly motivate one.
