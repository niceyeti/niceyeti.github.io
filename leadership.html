    TODO:
    - Polishing: probably the best example out there of an interactive resume: http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile
    - Quotes: Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.

    Possible additions:

    Personal:
    - Build a shelf of leadership examples: by building your shelf of leadership (books specifically, though not
    necessarily) you are inadvertently building a toolbox for future events, and a source of stability
    through volatile times.
    - When Leaders Fail: How to respond to 'bad' leaders? : We live in an age of misleadership. Period.
    But this diminishes our ability to learn from leaders who have made mistakes. Time spent diminishing
    is time wasted not building. There is a lot of Aurelius in this. Also recall the avalanche story with
    James at North Bend (McClelland butte?).
    - Myths of Leadership: do you have to be formally in charge to exercise leadership? No. Do you have
    to have extensive power and experience to develop your leadership skills? No. Can you benefit
    enormously by building up the leadership muscles of your mind? Absolutely. The focus would be on 
    young men in a bad economy, imparting experience, how to survive/thrive/build amidst decline by
    way of stoic independence, an developing a will to lead. Note my best leaders all had the 'lowest'
    social positions: Jeff at the shop, Juan at the casino, boomer tradesmen, Rick at the casino, etc.
    Leadership and clout are not the same; I succeeded beyond my home because I quietly improved myself
    and learned from others when others were chasing clout (and, frankly, dying of opiates etc).
    - Sentinels: sentinels are random individuals who bear witness to the upbringing and conditions of those in their
    local community. A perfect example is a former bus driver I met who drove the same route for eleven
    years, seeing the same kids develop from middle school through high school. He knew the 'trigger
    kids' by whom others would be diverted and encouraged toward problematic behavior. After leaving,
    the route went through five or more drivers in a single year. The sentinel was gone. Sentinels describe
    the social capital of an area.
    - Communication: written and spoken communication are virtually dead, but you're going to spend
    hours of your career in meetings for whatever reason. Oh well. Communication is a core component
    to developing leadership, for which the best tools are not coherently organized. But I think the
    best of these are: Strunk and Whites Elements of Style and Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence
    People. Beyond that its merely personal experience: lots of practice writing in school/college when you
    are young, then when you are older, lots of practice preserving and converting your experiences into 
    durable knowledge of things. Avoid the slide into "No Ragrets" gopnik. Value language: say what you
    mean and mean what you say. Language is the foremost signifier by which people understand that you 
    are a serious person (not an arrogant person but someone with objectives and respects others' objectives).
    Core themes are: language development, language significance (like formal clothes, good language signals
    sincere seriousness), language defiance (strong language fortifies one against charlatans), listening
    as a form of language (see how deeply you can memorize and understand a conversation with a stranger).

    Inverse list: my list of worst leadership books. Forgettable, clout-chasing,
    - Simon Sinek: the youtube clip-art of the leadership grift, Start With Why
    - Followership: promotes followership as good
    - The Art of War, The Prince, and generally anything DIY machiavellian in nature.
    - Harvard Business Review
    - LinkedIn
    - Leadership Gold and anything by Maxwell: is Maxwell overrated?
    - How to Be an Anti-Racist, We Cant Talk About That At Work, The New Jim Crow. HTBAAR tells
      multiple lies by about page 5, attributing quotes to people that they did not say; and yet the
      Navy has it on its reading list.
    - The Phoenix Project? Is this a book or failure porn?

    To read/review:
    - The Anatomy of Change - Richard Strozzi (Dominic recommendation)
    - Phoenix Project - I think this goes on the crap/pulp pile.

    This inspires a useful question about what makes a good leadership book:
    - it requires effort from the reader
    - the author has genuine experience/value they wish to pass along. are they writing for money/clout
      or would they have written something even if they believed it might not be written? Meditations for example.
    - it acknowledges a real failure in current leadership, but communicates it effectively and manifests though
      about mediating/resolving the difference

            <div class="simple-entry">To quote General Mattis, "If you don't read, you can't lead."
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><i>Call Sign Chaos</i>, General Jim Mattis</p>
                        <p>
                            I admire Mattis' calling for leaders
                            to '<i>protect their mavericks and risk takers, and reward initiative and
                                aggressiveness</i>'.
                            For Marines, aggressiveness clearly refers to those exercising the strongest initiative,
                            such as
                            youthful itinerants like young Mattis himself. Progress is impossible when
                            organizations are too timid to break
                            s***,
                            including organizational lassitude. Innovation requires aggressiveness. But leaders
                            must temper zeal with self-discipline and reading. To not read is to forego the acquired
                            knowledge for which previous
                            leaders believed it was worthwhile to record their experiences.
                            Thus if I could summarize Mattis' leadership principles, albeit inaccurately:
                        </p>
                        <ol style="margin: 10px 0px;">
                            <li>
                                Vertical alignment by intended outcomes, rather than detailed directives: "<b>in
                                    order to</b> take the bridge" "<b>in order to</b> deny egress" "<b>in order to</b>
                                _________"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Lateral aggressiveness and competency
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Learn from your predecessors, read voraciously
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Mattis spoke to a packed auditorium at my old university and his appeal is easy to
                            understand. The Marines' leadership mindset is well-compartmentalized: you have a role,
                            you understand your role, you fulfill your role. Combined with the values of fraternity,
                            self-discipline, and learning/adapting/exercising, it is easy to understand why that mindset
                            is
                            infectious, and likewise dovetails with Aurelius' stoicism. Solely for emphasizing reading
                            and listening, Mattis distinguishes himself as a leader capable of much greater public
                            significance. I wish to hear more of him in the future. When speaking on leadership and
                            democracy, he does so without engaging in the commonplace self-dealing prevalent within
                            universities, media, and corporations, a core reason for their decreasing
                            national relevance.

                        <p><i>Endurance</i>, Alfred Lansing</p>
                        <p>The greatest account of determination against oarlocks, the
                            Shackleton expedition's survival is arguably misattributed to Shackleton himself rather than
                            his team. The sequence of hardships they experienced exemplify Mattis' 'direct leadership'
                            as a chain of short-term contexts and decisions made under environmental uncertainty to
                            achieve a single long-term objective: saving as many crew as possible. Shackleton did so by
                            keeping problematic crew members nearer himself, but otherwise unleashing the capabilities
                            of a skilled team to operate independently and effectively. This is a credit to the team's
                            hand-picked composition, experts in their trades except for one stowaway. In their moment,
                            such men could not know what outcome might follow, only that positive outcomes would proceed
                            solely from their own actions. There is no luck but hard luck, but that is the best we have.

                            Survival narratives struggle against readers' natural psychological resistance to
                            fully contemplate a context in which absolute mortal consequences and uncertainty are
                            pitted against the personal commitment (and a difficult one) to act toward survival:
                            the acceptance of one's situation and the conscious choice to behave rationally and
                            agreeably toward difficult goals. The fascinating part about the team was their
                            cheery acceptance of circumstance, and the collective understanding of each man's value
                            and responsibilities, including the responsibility not to share spoiling attitudes in
                            the face of uncertainty. No bad situation is chosen, but good outcomes can only extend
                            from choice.

                            required for admission to the military history section at your local book store.
                            It is hard to conceive that T.E. Lawrence would today be a highly self-serious Tom Clancy
                            ghostwriter, or Wilfred Owen an operator of several 'osint' twitter accounts for reposting
                            graphic drone warfare videos as if they were 90s skater reel,
                            but seemingly not by 2022 standards. Further, even though professional military-history
                            narratives make good-faith attempts to memorialize events, they can disappoint because of
                            the loss of gritty
                            firsthand knowledge to second-hand authorship, very much including the vulgarity of real
                            events and participants. I was given a copy of Horse Soldiers by one of the event's actual
                            participants, only to puzzle over the author's descriptions of a detainee's
                            eyes resembling "cold tea". Tea color varies by temp? Er, whuh?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Murphy's law is a democracy of demons, in combat as much as engineering, and
                            doesn't reduce to solo-hero narrative formats and needless symbolism, i.e. "cold
                            tea". Given that the military is overwhelmingly working class, is it much to ask that its
                            authorship reflect that culture?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So nevermind that Sharp's book hails from the CAPITAL LETTERS
                            section, nor that much of the story may be deliberate fabrication (!).
                            A professional engineering is something I'd never encountered.
                            The beauty, of course, is that this memoir is about stealing a sunken Russian
                            submarine by engineering multiple massive and unproven custom apparatuses, coordinating
                            front companies and stories, Howard Hughes Corp, ops-sec lapses, Soviet surveillance, and a
                            large-scale project with mixed outcomes (familiar to any large software contract). Most of
                            us should stick to mastering the 25&#162; claw game at Safeway, but I hope Sharp kept the
                            240z and the K-129 fialka in the glovebox.

                            Given my personal fascination with Azorian, the most
                            interesting aspect is that the spy intrigue subsided and yielded
                            to a professional project memoir relatable to any
                            large-scale engineering project.
                            All such endeavors yield mixed outcomes and survivor-guilt
                            levels of personal second-guessing. Every engineer should blanche the
                            moment the heave-compensator slammed to its stops. The discipline
                            required to carry through such an extensive multi-year project is admirable in itself,
                            and one envies its field work. Azorian was an amazing undertaking,
                            unique for the scale of its managerial and engineering requirements, that ought to be more
                            well-known as a major Cold War military-engineering accomplishment. The beauty of Sharp's
                            memoir is that in an era when professional responsibility and leadership are
                            diminishing, Azorian exemplified the absolute professional obligations
                            faced by engineers, which is perhaps what makes the work so interesting and healthy.
                            It is not that I believe we are in an ethical malaise, but that compared with previous
                            generations, American culture seems notably unfamiliar with the assertiveness, discipline,
                            and inherent risk of more practical fields like engineering, despite being
                            a field laden with character-driven accomplishments. The movie 'First Man' even
                            removed the US flag from moon landing scenes over concerns about
                            nationalism--despite the fact that
                            the <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZyRbnpGyzQ">fundamental and stated
                                    purpose</a></i> of the space race
                            was the achievement of nationalistic Cold War aims.

                            But I look forward to seeing Azorian on the big screen, because even a mediocre
                            production would be entertaining given the merits of the project itself.

                            Marquet
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            'Turning followers into leaders' oozes TED Talk cliches. But on reflection,
                            <i>followership</i> forms the basis of every social media platform, most professional
                            credentials, and 99% of LinkedIn (which I ditched for exactly this reason). There is even a
                            book of the same title promoting 'followership' with all the false optimism of
                            marketing 3.0 aspirants from the early-oughts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marquet's book is terrific because it focuses on the genesis of leadership,
                            rather than leadership as-such. The latter is Steven Covey's poisonous 'personality ethic'
                            of leadership, which merely reinforces existing leadership roles without addressing
                            how they were created. The former seeks to understand how leaders are created
                            and the conditions thereof. For example, Marquet encourages the intentional use of language
                            to substitute subordination ("Sir, may I ____") with intent: "Sir, I intend to ____".
                            Conscientiously structuring language is the
                            low-hanging fruit of leadership praxis, a subtle mutual contract that a leader is
                            someone who creates other leaders. Marquet is a
                            good complement to Mattis' executive focus. Whereas Mattis' vertical leadership principle
                            emphasizes communicating intent downward, Marquet's principle emphasizes pushing
                            subordinates upward by harnessing their 'intent' and building up their autonomous
                            initiative. This appropriately decouples leaders and subordinates, notably without
                            obtuse language about 'decentralization'. Marquet does not seek to replace
                            leadership hierarchy but to ensure that it exists to maximize initiative and the creation
                            of new leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the main theme of Marquet's book is to encompass an entire organization in
                            leadership, and to not yield to reductive or embedded authority roles. A somewhat familiar
                            example to developers, I
                            worked at an organization where favoritism and dubious dev metrics resulted in some
                            workmates disproportionately receiving greenfield tasks, thus building their skillsets while
                            starving others equally qualified. Like all such non-linear point schemes, the scoring
                            merely encouraged developers to assign themselves easy tasks and discouraged more
                            difficult ones, which by definition can be nearly impossible to estimate (i.e. bug hunts).
                            The result was that many colleagues adopted an attitude of subordination precisely because,
                            being downstream of the objectives,
                            they were essentially required to ask permission to do work, while also being
                            discouraged from doing critically important work of quality and security. (This
                            organizational defect is what DevSecOps directly addresses through continuous integration
                            of quality and security.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the metrics disincentivized addressing quality issues, projects became progressively
                            more buggy, while also favoring the proliferation of new and undocumented code. Technical
                            debt exploded, like a fission experiment run amok.
                            And without greenfield tasks, downstream
                            workmates did not adequately develop their own creative intuition about how things could be
                            done, but were pinioned by what already had been done, and done very poorly.
                            Notably, many long-term developers did not advance their skillsets or experience, despite
                            doing lots of apparent work. Several moved on to better companies.
                            Likewise, providing insightful feedback regarding machine learning applications (a core
                            product domain), security, or open source dev productivity tooling was regarded with
                            suspicion by leads for being 'out of one's lane' or a threat to someone's kingdom. Virtually
                            the entire company's software activities were structured in this manner, as silo'ed, feuding
                            kingdoms, a matrix of rivalries that produced little for its partipants and turned the
                            software into internally-focused and awkwardly overlapping mishmash (good ole Conway's law).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Per Marquet, this team organization formed a self-fulfilling hierarchy of role-acquiescence.
                            Engineers' capabilities far exceeded the constraints created by upstream bottleneckers, but
                            the company culture presented toxic subservience as 'being a team player' and other
                            downright cringey cliches. Nor would I hesitate to work with any of those team members
                            again, whom I know to be bright and sensitive to criticism; I moved on for unrelated
                            reasons.
                            But without encouraging subordinates to develop leadership skills and technical
                            autonomy, and without cultivating an attitude that leadership may arise from any team
                            member:
                        <ul>
                            <li>capabilities are supplanted by subordination and a culture of asking permission.</li>
                            <li>leadership is replaced by 'management'</li>
                            <li>advancement is replaced by rework</li>
                            <li>accomplishment is not measured in completeness but in delegating broken products to
                                other groups</li>
                        </ul>
                        I attempted to specify the orthogonal components, each of which is defined by naturally
                        opposed forces: capability/subordination, leadership/management, growth/debt,
                        ownership/delegation. The description is nice because each component is a continuum,
                        and provides a practical mental diagnostic for organizational health. The left-hand
                        elements represent the long-term leadership health of an organization, whereas the right-hand
                        elements represent immediate value (the golden goose eggs, so to speak). The left-hand
                        elements are the opportunity costs of the right-hand elements. In the future, this
                        model might be representable using a radar plot, a personal favorite because it doesn't
                        emphasize perfection but continuous adjustment.

                        <p>
                            But I reflect on that experience solely in terms of lost capabilities and advancement,
                            and the weeks spent fixing bugs instead of developing relevant skills and valuable
                            products. My final year consisted almost entirely of re-work of others mistakes across
                            a collection of products, rather than actual work. On average, evaluating a single bug
                            led to the discovery of two or three more.
                            The experience is commonplace in an industry ruled by technical debt, but provides
                            a stark contrast to the Shackleton approach of assembling team members for autonomy, not
                            obedience to self-preserving hierarchy. It's always strange that highly intelligent
                            people can be so adept at role-acceptance as such (I am as guilty as anyone else).
                            Marquet's book is a refreshing antidote, especially in the tech
                            industry. A welcome read, and a book that should probably be re-read periodically.

                        <p> Servant Leadership reads more like Kant than leadership pulp. Whereas the latter is flatters
                            its readership to pump up book sales, Servant Leadership is valuable precisely because it
                            requires effort to grasp. Rather than tossing a cape on every middle-manager, bored
                            administrator, or appealing to readers' narcissisism, Servant Leadership represents
                            an earnest attempt to understand authority-based leadership. But here 'authority'
                            is not the embedded sort, but the the authority of real work, competency, and
                            earned value. What makes Servant
                            Leadership so current is that its message is retrograde to the stagnant, self-serving
                            realizations of leadership in 2020's America. However if you look for the servant-leaders
                            within any organization, you discover their actual structure and capabilities. I
                            once implemented a network-security project analyzing organizational hierarchy in the
                            Enron dataset and several employees within the company were easily identified as critical
                            servant-leaders, without whom the company could not have operated (otherwise ignoring
                            Enron's fate). Their titles or rank within the company did not match
                            the importance of their roles. Servant-leaders exist within every organization and provide
                            key operational insights. A quote from Greenleaf's site summarizes the core qualities of
                            servant-leadership:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <i>
                                The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make sure that
                                other people's highest priority needs are being served. The best test, and difficult to
                                administer, is: Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become
                                healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?
                                And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or at
                                least not be further deprived?
                            </i>

                        <p>
                            Servant-leadership is an explication of Marquet's belief that a leader
                            creates other leaders:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                it is evaluated based on the production of new leaders and autonomous action
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it emphasizes horizontal definitions of service
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                it refutes the utility of vertical hierarchies which diminish autonomy
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Greenleaf often strays into the arcadian weeds when praising a kind of horizontal
                            servant-leadership organization akin to every "empowerment" fad criss-crossing
                            career feeds. The historical arc of institutions pursuing
                            these agenda concludes with the strongest examples of staunch, vertical
                            authoritarianism (see Orwell's Animal Farm or any 2020's university campus).
                            Though I subscribe to servant-leadership in principle, I reject
                            Greenleaf's aesthetic. Or can it even have one? There was this one guy 2000 years ago who
                            mentioned something
                            about the corrosive societal consequences of performing deeds for recognition, versus
                            doing so without reciprocation and without a witness. Although I love the concept of
                            servant-leadership (as someone who has occupied the role in many companies)
                            I can leave the 1970's boomer-identity gospel and keep the practical bits. Vertical
                            hierarchy is not an intrinsic evil; it can easily be argued that horizontal
                            servant-leadership and vertical authority should simply be balanced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Peer within any company, no matter its health (hence the Enron example), and
                            you will find core staff who sincerely believe in its survival, mission, and purpose.
                            Their titles are usually a mismatch with respect to their unobserved operational importance.
                            But were they taught to do so?
                            Can servant leadership be taught, as quasi-leadership "empowerment" projects suggest?
                            I would be as radical as to claim that, for several generations now, America has lacked
                            any prior reference that would make servant-leadership intelligible to its
                            intended audience. It will be intelligible to those who already innately possess the value,
                            for whom no training is needed, and otherwise just another lever for covert self-service.
                            The problem is not servant-leadership, but of conflating it with objectives
                            that nullify the responsibility value that forms its basis. "Caring" and "empowerment"
                            do not of themselves bear competence; competence <i>is</i> caring, and extraordinary
                            competence is more or less a definition of servant-leadership. Therefore, if you want
                            to build leaders, build competence. Unleash their existing competencies, but also
                            define paths for them to achieve greater competence; not performance, <i>competence</i>.
                            A mistake I see in most companies is their belief that they must be optimized by finding
                            those with the correct competencies in the future, whereas building them internally would
                            yield those needs most effectively. The truth is that virtually no one knows what their
                            future needs are, just as we as developers should 'code for today' not for future
                            requirements that we cannot possibly predict.

                            So how can servant-leadership be realized, or is it the latest organizational fetish on
                            LinkedIn? A child of Cold War warriors and hunters, my siblings and I grew up mountaineering
                            and hunting. But I once had a friend who became enamoured with outdoor
                            magazines and fancied himself a mountaineer adventurer. When we climbed together, he was
                            completely incompetent and would easily become lost, mislead others, and fall into streams,
                            but was also unwilling to learn basic skills. Evidently to be enamoured with skills does not
                            impart them. In mountaineering it was routine to encounter dangerous dilletantes,
                            most of whom put themselves or others in critical danger and in need of rescue.
                            Trendy leadership crusades represent a similar confusion between skill and the work that
                            begets it, diminishing the required work out of envy for skill:
                            genuine leadership skills are not a thing in-themselves to be bought like transferrable
                            currency or status products (Teslas, iphones, etc).

                        <p>
                            Skill is an expression of work, of an individual's commitment to surmount the burdens
                            of a task, subject, etc. The assumption that it might be easily transferrable reflects
                            a fundamental misunderstanding of the long-term requirements of leadership, and seemingly
                            violates servant-leadership's core ethos, which is that leadership is
                            <i>doing work</i>. As stated prior, leadership <i>is</i> striving for extraordinary
                            competence.
                            Defined as such, and not to be too stereotypical, who are servant
                            leaders but plumbers and janitors? By contrast, what then of the credential spigot
                            of a higher education system awash in elitism, for which every
                            accomodation and recognition <i>must</i> be made, no matter how frivolous or unyielding of
                            applied value? The financial premise to borrow lavishly for a college degree (particularly
                            advanced degrees in law, management, and STEM) is overtly classist: 'a degree
                            gains you entry to the over-class'. Thereby those decrying class barriers are the ones
                            reaffirming them and standing in the way. As an aside, a core reason I bailed out on
                            pursuing law school, even after acing the LSAT, was that every current and prospective law
                            student seemed to be using the prestige of a law degree as a means to <i>avoid doing
                                work</i>. Law schools essentially solicit and advance this attitude.
                            The supposition of an insider class&mdash;programmers,
                            lawyers, directors, etc.&mdash;contradicts the notion of work: how does a diploma confer
                            permission to work and produce value? How can it confer leadership by precluding it?
                            What is the survival timeline of servant-leadership in an era of institutionalized
                            mimetic-envy? Of eased character and leadership standards? These are controversial but
                            necessary questions for Greenleaf.

                        <p>
                            Gates of Fire can be a bit of an over-the-top account of Spartan soldiers
                            written from the perspective of a tightjawed New England spectator of 'hardship'.
                            But for anyone of a harder upbringing, those whose teens and twenties were a long
                            train of hardship jobs and thankless trades skills, or those who privately cringe
                            whenever the LinkedIn crowd slings terms like "grit", this book is an enjoyable
                            foray into the past hardship that secretly motivate oneself.
